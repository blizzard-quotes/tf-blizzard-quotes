= terraform-aws-blizzard-quotes

== Summary

Repository housing the terraform configuration files for configuring the
the infrastructure for the blizzard-quotes AWS account.

Not much infrastructure to configure since everything in the blizzard-quotes account
is serverless and deployed via the serverless framework.
See https://github.com/blizzard-quotes for the api repositories which use
the serverless framework.

Primarily configures resources necessary to deploy a serverless Swagger UI
for blizzard-quotes apis. Raw specification files can be found under specifications/.
Also configures certificates, groups, users, and other miscellaneous resources.

Costs are meant to be kept to a minimum. Currently only costs ~ $0.50 to $0.55 a month
(The HostedZone costs $50) with apis active. 
The domain name blizzard-quotes.com costs $12 a year.

Every resource for blizzard-quotes should be configured through this repository
or an application using the serverless framework. 
The only exception at the moment are the SNS topic subscriptions.

== Additional work

Additional work which may or may not be accomplished as time passes.

* Store tf-state in an s3 backend
** Necessary if passwords or multiple people collaborate in this account at the same time
* Refactor root module into multiple root modules
** Not a necessity, but helpful
