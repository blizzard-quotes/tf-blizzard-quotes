= tf-blizzard-quotes

== Summary

Repository housing the terraform configuration files for configuring the
the infrastructure for the blizzard-quotes AWS account.

Not much infrastructure to configure since everything in the blizzard-quotes account
is serverless and deployed via the serverless framework.
See https://github.com/blizzard-quotes for the api repositories which use
the serverless framework.

Primarily configures resources necessary to deploy a serverless Swagger UI
for blizzard-quotes apis. Raw specification files can be found under specifications/.
Also configures certificates, groups, users, and other miscellaneous resources.

Costs are meant to be kept to a minimum. Currently only costs ~ $0.50 to $0.55 a month
(The Hosted Zone costs $0.50) with apis active. 
The domain name blizzard-quotes.com costs $12 a year.

Every resource for blizzard-quotes should be configured through this repository
or an application using the serverless framework. 
The only exception at the moment are the SNS topic subscriptions.
